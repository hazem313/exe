## Building the Executable

To build the executable for your Python script, you can use the PyInstaller tool. Follow the steps below:

1. Install PyInstaller using pip:

2. Save your Python script as `your_script_name.py`.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.

4. Run the following command to create a standalone .exe file:

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your Python script.

The `--onefile` option tells PyInstaller to create a single executable file instead of a directory with multiple files.

5. PyInstaller will create the .exe file in the `dist` subdirectory within the directory where your Python script is located. The name of the .exe file will be the same as your Python script name.
